# Image Upscaler using Real-ESRGAN

This project automates the process of upscaling images using Real-ESRGAN while cleaning filenames and organizing outputs into timestamped folders.

## üöÄ Features
- Automatically **removes spaces and parentheses** from filenames.
- **Detects GPU** being used (NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD).
- **Uses `tqdm` progress bar** for clean status updates.
- Creates a **new timestamped folder** for every upscale session.
- **Suppresses unnecessary console logs** from Real-ESRGAN.

## üìÇ Folder Structure
```
/image_upscaler_project
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                   # Run this to start upscaling
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ image_upscaler.py          # Core processing logic
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt           # Dependencies list
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ inputs/                    # Place images here
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/

## üîß Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/224Abhay/Image-Upscaler-using-realesrgan.git
cd Image-Upscaler-using-realesrgan
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Real-ESRGAN

Use the Ones i have provided.

OR

Download **Real-ESRGAN** from the official GitHub:
üëâ [Real-ESRGAN Releases](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/releases)

Ensure `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe` is placed in your system PATH or in the project directory.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéØ How to Use
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add Images
Place your images inside the `inputs/` folder.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
Run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Output
- The script will detect your GPU and upscale images.
- Upscaled images will be saved in `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/`.
- A progress bar will show the upscaling process.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- If you see **"Real-ESRGAN not found!"**, make sure `realesrgan-ncnn-vulkan.exe` is installed and accessible.
- If `inputs/` is empty, the script will prompt you to add images before running.
